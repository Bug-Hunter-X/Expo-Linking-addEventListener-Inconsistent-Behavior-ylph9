This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` function may fail to trigger if the app is already running and handling a deep link. This can cause unexpected behavior where the app doesn't navigate to the correct screen or doesn't process the deep link as intended.  This usually happens when testing on an emulator or physical device and the app is not properly restarted between tests.
